Today I was flurried by the [information](http://www.businessinsider.com/github-the-full-inside-story-2016-2) about Github changing
its structure from flat company with remote work culture to a yet another corporate being.

In the article is written that large amount of Github devs aren't happy about the company transformation. They started to depart from the company. The atmosphere also degraded.

I think that every change appears to be painful and the reasons - huge grow from 50 to 500 in short period of time in order to satisfy demands from huge enterprises, is a good reason to incorporate changes and if the changes could keep the work culture and atmosphere, it would be perfect. I don't know, if there exists other forms of structured company that size than corporate. I hope, there are. Perhaps GitHub could find such.

I wonder what will happen as next. GitHub was and is great supporter for open source community and its loose would more than unfortunate. The future will show.
